"""
For a web developer, it is very
important to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific
rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular
web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given
target area.

2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.

3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.

You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed
in sequence.

Note:
The given area won't exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer
The web page's width and length you designed must be positive integers.
