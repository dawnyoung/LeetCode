"""
Given a positive integer, output its complement number.
The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary
representation.

Note:

1) The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed
integer.

2) You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
